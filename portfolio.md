## 🌟 Architectural Vision & System Design

This repository serves as an interactive development and prototyping environment for Generative AI model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. Rather than treating Jupyter Notebooks as isolated scratchpads, this system is architected as a modular, reproducible pipeline where notebooks act as the orchestrators for underlying high-performance PyTorch and Hugging Face workflows.

### Core Data & System Flow
*   **Ingestion / Input**: Raw instruction-tuning datasets are ingested, cleaned, and passed through a deterministic tokenization pipeline. Dynamic padding and smart batching are applied to minimize computational overhead during training.
*   **Processing / Logic**: The training loop leverages Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Computation is optimized using mixed-precision (BF16/FP16) and gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes on constrained hardware.
*   **Persistence & Caching**: Model checkpoints, adapter weights, and tokenizer configurations are serialized using the secure `safetensors` format. Intermediate states are cached locally using memory-mapped files to prevent redundant data processing.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Engineering Decisions

Every technology choice in this pipeline was made to balance developer velocity, resource constraints, and mathematical precision.

*   **Execution Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks were selected to provide an interactive, stateful interface for hyperparameter exploration, loss curve visualization, and rapid prototyping of model architectures.
*   **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch serves as the foundational tensor computation engine, offering low-level control over gradients and memory allocation.
*   **Model Abstraction & Optimization**: Hugging Face `transformers` and `peft` were chosen to standardize model loading, while `bitsandbytes` provides the 4-bit/8-bit quantization layers necessary to run large-scale models on commodity enterprise hardware.
*   **Experiment Tracking**: Weights & Biases (W&B) integration ensures that every training run is fully logged, versioned, and reproducible.
